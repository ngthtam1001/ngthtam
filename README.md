"Please consider the following options for viewing the document that contains both code and its output in various formats:

HTML Format: I recommend downloading the HTML file to get the best experience. HTML files are easily readable in web browsers and can display both the code and its visual outputs, such as graphs and tables.

R Markdown (.rmd) Format: If you prefer to access the raw source code and markdown text, download the .rmd file. This format is ideal for those who want to view or edit the code directly in an R environment like RStudio.

DOCX Format: If you encounter any issues with the above formats, you can use the DOCX file as an alternative. DOCX files are compatible with common word processors like Microsoft Word and can display the document's content, although they may not handle dynamic outputs as effectively as HTML
